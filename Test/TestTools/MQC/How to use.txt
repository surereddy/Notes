Query for test lab:
------------------------
- Modify connection properties
  Open the excel, go to menu 'DATA', click 'Connections'. 
  Then in the Connection Properties window, go to tab 'Definition'.
  Connection string: Change DATABASE= string.
  Command text, change last line CF_ITEM_NAME and replace with your test lab folder name, it must be unique in the tree, 
  but it does not matter in which level.
  e.g.   where CF_ITEM_NAME = 'Post L3R7 VCU 16.0.8'
  Click OK to close the properties window, and it will pull the data from database and update the spreadsheet.
  
  Note: The test lab structure must meet below criteria:
        Say 'Post L3R7 VCU 16.0.8' is your targeted directory, there must be 1 level and only 1 level sub-folder under 'Post L3R7 VCU 16.0.8'.
		e.g. folder 'Post L3R7 VCU 16.0.8'\'TDC' and 'BDC', or ost L3R7 VCU 16.0.8'\'TestCases', then test sets, then test cases.
		If there is not sub-folder under your targeted directory, select upper folder and filter your test cases later.

FAQ:
----------------------
- Un-checkin'ed changes
For un-checkin'ed changes, they are in VC_TEST, VC_DESSTEPS tables. They are visable in GUI only to the person who checkout. 
Once the version is checked in, it will be removed from VC_* tables.
Table TEST and DESSTEPS have the checked-in version.
