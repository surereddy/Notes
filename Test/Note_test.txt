|- * Notes *
||- Testability examples
Check client - server transaction failure or response time.

Testability:
Add timestamp of when client sends request and receives response into log.
Add timestamp of when server receives request and sends response into log.

||- Benefits of reviewing detailed design
The correspondent carAdvice website example:
The car review comment requires Facebook login. But from the review filling form you see it at the most uses the names from your Facebook account.
But the bug was when you do not set the gender in Facebook account, the submit fails. 
Because the server retrieves the gender info and convert it to 1 for male, 0 for female, and fails when the field is null.

With blackbox or feature requirement review, you won’t be able to see this issue. 

||- Trust (consult) v.s. not Trust dev
Sometimes consult and trust developers may save unnecessary time and cut some cases.
For example:
TEK AA: If add a new column in report, do we need to test view result, saved report and email notification with report as attachment?
For QA, of course it is better to test all of them.
But if develpoer says they are all generated from one same place. We may only need to test one.

||- Fail in only one server, pass in others.
If a case fails in a specific server, but pass in others, don't let it go.
First of all, make sure it is always reproduced at this server, and there is no configuration error.
If it is always reproduced and there is no configuration error as you can see, log a defect!

Some issues are exposed in certain circumstance. 
For instance, in TEK DirectQuality, the maximum duration of BIVQ-SIP test plan with post dial string has issue on CDC_2_EP6 and CDC_2_EP7 only.
It is because the id of them in database is duplicated with the id of another table of destination. 

||- Weird issue and you don't see the rule, but log the issue!
Sometimes you will see some weird issues, and you can't find the rule from QA point of view. But once the issue is there, log the defect!
There must be a reason and a rule, it is just beyond the view of QA.

For instance, in TEK DirectQuality, the maximum duration of BIVQ-SIP test plan with post dial string has issue on CDC_2_EP6 and CDC_2_EP7 only.
Compare the SIP profile and SIP endpoint configuration with other SIP endpoints, they were very similar, or could say the same. But only these two SIP EP got the issue.
It is because the id of them in database is duplicated with the id of another table of destination. You won't never see this rule from GUI.


|- Test Strategy and Test Plan
||- Test Strategy:
IMO, what to test and not test; who (skill level) test; test tools; tester number v.s. schedule; risks for test limitation, high level test design / test points (O). 

TEK geoblade example:
Test Strategy - This document. Describes the scope, approach, resources and schedule for the testing activities of the project. 
This includes defining what will be tested, who will perform testing, how testing will be managed, and the associated risks and contingencies.

||- Test Plan:
IMO, time schedule, human resource, test environment / tools / test data (traffic) needs, what to test (High level, like feature ID, story ID), risk.

|--------------
|- * Content design: *
|--------------
Functional, Performance/Load, Stability(Longtime call,longtime repetition),Robustness(illegal parameter, boundaries ,Break test like unpluging card or shutdown),
Security test,Installation/Upgrade, Regression, 

|--------------
|- * QA requirement *
|--------------
||- From Microsoft SDET:
Understanding in exquisite detail how customers will use the product. 
creative enough to think like millions of customers.
Remember, the basic responsibility is to make sure the feature works. Then, consider all the factors that could cause problems. 
What are the security implications of the feature? Will it work in another country? How can I stress this code? What are the boundaries and error conditions?

|- * (TEK) Managing Quality - Design/Code/Case Review and Inspection, UT *
|--------------
Terms:
Review - Personal Review with a check list. 
Inspection - Team review with a check list. 

Work flow:
Author does the review first.
Then send out for team review.
Team review and send back comments or enter defects.
Hold a inspection meeting to identify and discuss the defects and comments.
Unit test -> functional test / integration test by developers.
Deliver high quality build to QA. < 0.3 defects / story point.

Advantage:
The earlier stage a bug is found, the less time it is cost.

||- Things to better test in UT than SIT:
1. Timeout handling
For example, it is required to test ORU disconnect the call in 60 seconds if TRU does not disconnect the call. 
It is easy to test in code. Change timeout constant from 60 to 6 sec and test timeout.

2. Boundary check
Ideally this can be ensured in UT and SIT does not care it at all.

|- * Performance Test: *
|--------------
Modules:
1. 并发数。能及时处理，测瞬间最大并发处理能力。
2. 长时间。如24h长话测试。
3. 长时间并发/负压稳定性。
4. 稳定性，长期重复操作不出问题
5. 长期负压+稳定性测试：模拟实际情况
   如点播performance test，50用户同时不断的做点播5分钟关掉重连操作，持续24h。

Key monitor values(As LoadRunner shows as defaults):
1. Running users
2. Trancation response time
3. TPS / Hit Per Second / Caps
4. Server resources

LoadRunner's result Analysis tool is good.
It can create html report and its report summary page includes above 4 values, duration and total throughout.
It can also create word report but it's summary is not good and not same as analysis windows shows.

||- performance check cmds
vmstat：（cpu/mem/io throughout）
iostat：设备的IO统计 linux 默认没有
netstat：网络活动信息统计
top：cpu/mem/io wait
cat /proc/meninfo：查看系统的总men大小
cat /proc/cpuinfo：查看系统总CPU大小
df –k：查看系统硬盘大小

I/O:
These tools include top, vmstat, iostat, and sar.

|- * User Experience test(界面友好性测试)*
|--------------
1. 默认焦点(next,finish,第一个文本输入框) ×
2. Tab顺序 ×
3. 字体设置
4. 界面元素的尺寸

|- * Case and Test Efficiency/plan *
|--------------
Case:
TEK AA:
After reading the requirement and design, and already making a test list, 
it takes about 1 case/1 hour to write the cases, about half page of each case.


Test:
Experience Data(SVT):
功能: 2~3case/人天
性能：1case/2天×2人

|- * Installation / Upgrade *
|--------------
||- Default value in configuration
Default configuraton values should be universal.
Ex. vau config.xml vsp standard or not causes RTP substream wrong seq.
