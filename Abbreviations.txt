Call Parking	The call is parked at the network, and the GNP is able to prevent the FRC service as soon as an agent becomes free in order to route the parked call to this agent. 
Call Qualification	The FRC service connects the calling to a SRF in order to retrieve some digits. Those digits are sent to the GNP, and this latter will use the received digits in its routing strategy in order to choose the destination number.
Global Routing Strategy	The global routing strategy includes the configuration of the translation tree in FRC service and the routing strategy defined at the GNP level.
IN Call Transfer	A call transfer started by the call center agent and performed by the FRC service. So, when the agent sends the new routing destination to the GNP and then he releases the call, the FRC service requests a new destination to the GNP. The new routing destination sent by the GNP will be used by the service to perform a new connection. This call transfer is doing with no tromboning on the network.
Rerouting	A rerouting is performed when, in case of failure, an alternative destination is chosen by the FRC service.
Routing number	The destination provided by the FRC translation tree.
Routing destination	The number to whom the calling party will be connected. It may be provided either by the FRC translation tree or by the GNP depending on the applied scenario.
Routing Strategy	The routing strategy is defined at the GNP. It defines the routing destination for a request depending on different criteria like time, site load, available agents, agent skills…
Translation Tree	The translation tree is defined in the FRC service. It’s used by the service to choose the destination number or to decide whether a request to the GNP is required.
Tserver	It is the link between the SCP(s) and the call centers. Tserver is a Genesys product
Computer-telephony( integration (CTI)	The use of computers to manage telephone calls. Applications include  intelligent call routing, screen popping (putting a customer’s information on  an agent’s screen along with delivering the call) and caller authentication Sometimes simply “computer telephony.”

DMZ 是英文“demilitarized zone”的缩写，中文名称为“隔离区”，
Ad hoc network 指临时应变的特定网络。由若干个移动的无线通信终端构成一个临时应变的网络。
               这种网络是临时性的、无中心的，无需依靠任何基础设施的非标准网络。因此可称作是“自组织网络”。
               也有人称它是“特定网络”，是因为它是很短距离的特定连接，并且只能用于近距离的用户，又因为它是便于加入和离开，既能主控，
               又能被控的网络，所以又有人称之为“对等网络”。

SAN：（Storage Area Network and SAN Protocols） 存储区域网络及其协议   
　　存储区域网络（SAN）是一种高速网络或子网络，提供在计算机与存储系统之间的数据传输。
NAS：network-attached storage

SAN是计算机信息处理技术中的一种架构，它将服务器和远程的计算机存储设备（如磁盘阵列、磁带库）连接起来，使得这些存储设备看起来就像是本地一样。
和SAN相反，NAS使用基于文件（file-based）的协议，如NFS、SMB/CIFS等，在这里仍然是远程存储，但计算机请求的是抽象文件中的一部分，而不是一个磁盘块。
