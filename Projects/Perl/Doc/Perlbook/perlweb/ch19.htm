<P>

The CD-ROM included with this book contains the source code and

reference materials that have been developed throughout the book.

The goal of this approach is to allow you to cut and paste any

applicable code examples so that you can reuse them quickly, as

well as provide the scripts, applications, and sample Web pages

in complete form.

<P>

Another (and perhaps more exciting) goal of the CD-ROM is to provide

new, unique, and helpful software, shareware, and evaluation software

for you to use. To that end, you'll find an array of software,

including the add-ins, utilities, and other software packages

that we've been able to arrange for you.

<P>

Following is an overview of what you can expect:

<UL>

<LI>All the sample code and applications from the book

<LI>A collection of demonstration applications, scaled-down software,

and shareware

<LI>An electronic version of this book in HTML format, which you

can read in any World Wide Web browser on any platform

<LI>An electronic version of this book in Windows Help File format,

which allows you to quickly search for and annotate any topic

covered in the book

<LI>The CD contains several subdirectories located off the root

directory. Table C.1  lists the directories that you'll find on

the CD, along with application, code, or chapter-specific subdirectories.

The products on the CD are demos and shareware. You might have some difficulty running these programs on your machine; if you do, feel free to contact the vendor. (Vendors would rather have you evaluate their products than ignore them.)</BLOCKQUOTE>

<I>Special Edition</I> <I>Using Perl for Web Programming </I>is

available as an HTML document that you can read in any World Wide

Web browser installed on your machine (such as Internet Explorer

or Netscape Navigator). If you don't have a Web browser, you'll

find Microsoft Internet Explorer on the CD-ROM. You also can read

the book on-screen as a Windows Help File.

<H3><A NAME="ReadingtheElectronicBookasanHTMLDocument">

Reading the Electronic Book as an HTML Document</A></H3>

<P>

To read the electronic book, start your Web browser and open the

document file TOC.htmL, located in the \HTMLVER subdirectory of

the CD. Alternatively, you can browse the CD directory by using

File Manager and double-clicking TOC.htmL.

<P>

After you open the TOC.htmL page, you can access the book's contents

by clicking a highlighted chapter number or topic name. The electronic

book works like any other Web page; when you click a hot link,

a new page opens or the browser takes you to the new location

in the document.

<P>

As you read the electronic book, you will notice other highlighted

words or phrases. Clicking one of these cross-references also

takes you to a new location in the electronic book. You can always

use your browser's forward or backward button to return to your

original location.

Installing the Internet Explorer</A></H3>

<P>

If you don't have a Web browser installed on your machine, you

can use Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.0, which is included on

the CD-ROM.

<P>

The Microsoft Internet Explorer can be installed from the self-extracting

file in the \EXPLORER directory. Double-click MSIE20.EXE, or use

the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs option and follow the

instructions in the installation routine.<BR>

Reading the Electronic Book as a Windows Help File Document

</A></H3>

<P>

To read the electronic book as a Windows Help File document, open

the file named PERLWP.HLP in the \EBOOKS subdirectory of the CD-ROM.

 Clicking the forward or backward arrow moves you forward or backward

through the text of the book, chapter by chapter. To view the

book's table of contents, select the Contents tab; then click

the number of the chapter that you want to view.

Finding Sample Code</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

As you read this book, you will notice sample applications and

program segments set apart from the main text by a <I>code listing

header</I>, like this one:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<PRE>

Listing 10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;(10_01.htm) Creating the new snarfle page...

</PRE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

This listing indicates that this particular code snippet (or example)

is included on the CD. To find the code, browse to the \CODE subdirectory

on the CD, and select the file name that matches the one referenced

in the listing header from the chapter indicated. For this example,

you would look in the <A HREF="ch10.htm" tppabs="http://www.mcp.com/818726400/0-7897/0-7897-0659-8/ch10.htm" >Chapter 10</A> subdirectory and open the 10_01.htm

file.
