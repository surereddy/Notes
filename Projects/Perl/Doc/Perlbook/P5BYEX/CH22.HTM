<P>

If you've read the rest of this book, you have a fairly good understanding

of Perl. This chapter introduces you to some resources that can

take you to the next level of understanding. You can see which

Usenet newsgroups are best to read, where to find Perl scripts

that you can copy and modify for your own use, and other useful

information.

<P>

First, you can read about Usenet, a service that uses news articles

to deliver information. You can browse through the newsgroups

and pick up useful information. Additionally, any time you have

a question on Perl or CGI programming you can post the question

to a newsgroup. Responses to questions are usually quick if your

subject lines are well thought-out and descriptive.

<P>

Next, some Web sites you can visit are listed. They have useful

Web, CGI, and Perl related libraries, sample scripts, and documentation

that can be extremely helpful.<BR>

If you are new to CGI programming with Perl, you will want to visit each of these sites listed in this chapter. Doing this will give you a good understanding of what is available to help you become a great CGI programmer. As you visit the sites, keep 
track of useful files that can be downloaded that interest you, iNCluding their version and the date. You might also bookmark the site in your Web browser. When you are done visiting all the sites, you will know where to access the most recent of the tools 
and you can begin to download and build your own CGI development library.</BLOCKQUOTE>

Usenet is an Internet service that distributes articles or messages

between servers. Each article is targeted to a specific newsgroup.

You need a news reader program in order to download articles from

the news server to your local machine.<BR>

<P>

The most useful Perl-related newsgroup is comp.lang.perl.misc

because of the breadth of topics that are covered. This is the

newsgroup you will most likely post to when you are having a Perl

language problem or simply have a question that needs answering.

<TR><TD><B>Caution</B></TD></TR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

It is generally considered poor manners to post your question in more than one newsgroup. Most people monitor at least three of the four Perl newsgroups and will be annoyed to see your question multiple times.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<A HREF="f22-1.gif" tppabs="http://202.113.16.101/%7eeb%7e/Perl%205%20By%20Example/f22-1.gif"><B>Figure 22.1 : </B><I>A random sample of the Article in the comp.lang.perl.misc

Newsgroup</I>.</A>

<P>

Before you post to any newsgroup, <B>read the Perl FAQ</B>. A

<I>FAQ</I> is a frequently-asked questions document. If you ask

a question that is already answered in the FAQ document, you will

be yelled at by other people reading the list. At all times, remember

that you are asking others for their help. They are under no obligation

to help. If you are rude, insulting, uNClear, or lazy, you can

expect the same treatment in return. To quote Patrick Swayze in

the movie <I>Roadhouse</I>, &quot;Be polite!&quot;

<P>

You can find the FAQ on the <B>http://www.perl.com/perl/faq/</B>

Web page. In addition, this site will point you to other FAQs.

<P>

The comp.lang.perl.modules newsgroup is very helpful, both to

check out what modules are available and how they are being used,

and if you have any questions or problems with existing Perl modules,

or want to ask about the existeNCe of modules to support a particular

need.

<P>

The comp.lang.perl.tk newsgroup is a forum to discuss Tk and Perl.

<I>Tk</I> is an interface tool developed by Sun, primarily to

use with <I>Tcl</I>, an embeddable scripting language. There have

been Tk extensions made to Perl5 to allow integration. If you

are interested in using both, you will definitely want to check

out this newsgroup. You can also find a FAQ at the <B>http://w4.lns.cornell.edu/~pvhp/ptk/ptkFAQ.html</B>

web page.

<P>

Another useful newsgroup is comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi.

It will contain many refereNCes to CGI programming using Perl,

which is one of the more popular approaches to CGI. Look at all

of the newsgroups beginning with comp.infosystems.www for those

that meet your needs.

<H2><A NAME="WebSites"><FONT SIZE=5 COLOR=#FF0000>

Web Sites</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

The following sites are good places to visit to build up your

Perl or CGI script library. In addition, the sites will begin

to give you an exact idea of what already exists that you can

use, or modify for your own use. You will be amazed at what is

available that is either freeware or shareware.

<H3><A NAME="ThePerlLanguageHomePage">

The Perl Language Home Page</A></H3>

<P>

<B>http://www.perl.com</B>

<P>

The Perl language home page is connected to the Internet via a

28.8K link, so be prepared to wait a little bit while downloading.

Around the end of July, the server was having difficulties staying

up-hopefully they have been resolved by the time you read this.

<P>

However, when the site is available, it has valuable information.

You should definitely stop in and browse.

<H3><A NAME="PearlsofWisdombyLarryWall">

Pearls of Wisdom by Larry Wall</A></H3>

<P>

<B>ftp://convex.com/pub/perl/info/lwall-quotes</B>

<P>

Larry Wall is the inventor of Perl. His admirers have created

this web page to commemorate some of Larry's wittier comments.

<P>

Larry as a nice guy: 

<P>

&quot;Even if you aren't in doubt, consider the mental welfare

of the person who has to maintain the code after you, and who

will probably put parens in the wrong place.&quot;-Larry Wall

in the perl man page

<P>

Larry as a philosopher: 

<P>

&quot;What is the sound of Perl?  Is it not the sound of a wall

that people have stopped banging their heads against?&quot;-Larry

Wall in &lt;1992Aug26.184221.29627@ netlabs.com&gt;

<P>

Larry as a computer nerd:

<P>

&quot;I might be able to shoehorn a refereNCe count in on top

of the numeric value by disallowing multiple refereNCes on scalars

with a numeric value, but it wouldn't be as clean. I do occasionally

worry about that.&quot; -lwall

<P>

Larry as a programmer with impossible specifications:

<P>

&quot;You want it in one line? Does it have to fit in 80 columns?

:)&quot;-Larry Wall in &lt;7349@jpl-devvax.JPL.NASA.GOV&gt;

One of the best places to begin a search for information or for

files is at Yahoo. This is one of the better organized and comprehensive

search sites on the Web.

The Internet Relay Chat service is a powerful tool. If you're

lucky you can connect with very knowledgeable people who will

answer your questions. The advantage of IRC is that you can hold

a real-time conversation with other people. You ask a question,

they respond. You can then ask for clarification or actually try

the advice. If you still have a problem, you can ask for more

advice. Figure 22.4 shows a random snapshot of the IRC channels.

Summary</FONT></A></H2>

<P>

You've finally reached the end of the journey that was mentioned

in <A HREF="ch1.htm" tppabs="http://202.113.16.101/%7eeb%7e/Perl%205%20By%20Example/ch1.htm" >Chapter 1</A> &quot;Getting Your Feet Wet.&quot; I hope you enjoyed

reading this book as much as I enjoyed writing it. While I was

doing research, I took advantage of every resource listed in this

chapter. If you have unanswered questions, I urge you to ask them

either in IRC or the relevant newsgroup. With today's fast communications

it doesn't make sense to hold up a project when the answer might

be available in minutes or hours.

<P>

The easiest resource to use is the Usenet newsgroups. Simply send

a message to an appropriate newsgroup with a carefully worded

subject line before you leave work for the evening. The odds are

good that you will have a response by the next morning. Most of

time you should use the <TT>comp.lang.perl.misc</TT>

newsgroup.

<P>

When you have some unruly code that should work but doesn't, consider

looking on the Perl home page (<B>http://www.perl.com</B>) to

see if a new bug has been found. 

<P>

If you need ideas or would like to get a head start on your next

programming project, you can search for Perl programs at the Yahoo

(<B>http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Programming_Languages/Perl/</B>)

Web site. By starting at the Yahoo site, you always see an updated

list of available Perl resources. Some sites (like Dale Dewley's-<B>http://www.engr.iupui.edu/~dbewley/perl/</B>)

has resources that you will refer to over and over again.

<P>

Sometimes, you absolutely can't wait for an answer. When you have

pressing deadlines or your brain is frazzled, turn to the #perl

channel on an Efnet IRC server.

<P>

At this point there's nothing left to say but...<BR>

Happy Programing!
