I have removed the big SQL Server transaction log file (more than 40 G) in DQ 93 by following steps because there was really little space left in Drive C.
1. Detach the DirectReach database
2. Rename the transaction log file from disk. Don't delete for now in case attaching database fails.
3. Attach the DirectReach database. It will promts the log file is Not Found, select the log file and remove it, then click OK to attach. It will create a new empty transaction file named DirectReach_log.LDF.  See attached screenshot for this step.
4. Delete the old transaction log file.
