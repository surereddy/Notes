sudo passwd -u root 
to unlock the account. This should return

passwd: password expiry information changed

#Reverting back
#If you want to disable root account in Ubuntu you need to lock the root account by using the following command 
sudo passwd -l root

Just below it, add the following line:
PermitRootLogin yes

#Then restart SSH:
service ssh restart
