|- How to use ssh key to login without password
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys

Theory:
It is a pair of private and public keys.
private is an identity of client, and could be copied to any client machine to re-use.
public key is put at target server host, and it matches the private key for authentication.

It doesn't matter where you generate the pair, you can do it at client or server host, or even other hosts.
Just remember to put public key at server host authorized_keys, and private key at client host.


Generating RSA Keys

This should be done on the client.
To create your public and private SSH keys on the command-line:
su - peter
mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa

# Empty for no passphrase is okay. Or you want one, you will be prompted to enter passphrase of the ssh key in log in for further security.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 

Your identification has been saved in /home/peter/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/peter/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.


Transfer Client Key to Target Server Host
Copy the 'one line' full content from client /home/peter/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to append to target server host's authorized_keys, 
e.g. /root/.ssh/authorized_keys if you want to log on the target server as root.

The pub key is a LONG line content and displayed as multi lines, you may copy them as multi-lines by mistake and it won't work.
Easy ways:
1. Copy the id_rsa.pub from client to server, e.g. to /root/id_rsa.pub, then append to authorized_keys.
   cat /root/id_rsa.pub >> ~root/.ssh/authorized_keys
 

To use:
ssh <target user>@<target server host>
e.g. ssh root@128.199.98.56

Or you can specify the private location by -i, e.g.,
ssh -i ~peter/.ssh/id_rsa peter@128.199.98.56


Notes:
1. The private key generated in linux cannot be used in putty in windows because putty has its format to write and read the private key file.
	You will need to generate a key pair by puttygen for putty usage, and copy the public key while in the puttygen window to the target host. 
	Don't save the public key as a file and then copy it since it is not in correct 'one line' format anymore.
